# James Webb Space Telescope Website

A microsite highlighting photographs from the James Webb Space Telescope.

## Overview

The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was launched in December 2021 and has already sent back some incredible photographs. This microsite focuses on JWST and six of the stunning photos the telescope has captured.

This project was completed in December 2022 as a final project for the MPCS 52553 Web Development class at the University of Chicago. The project could be completed in either HTML/JavaScript or using React/Node.js so this repository contains code for both deployments.
